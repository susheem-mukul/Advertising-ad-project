# Advertising-ad-project
The main objective of this project is to decide whether the customer clicked on a Ad or not.
In the data provided to us we have data related to age,area income,city,sex etc , so by doing data analysis and using seaborn and matplotlib library we inferred various results.
Then the data was split into training and test set using train_test_split.
Since it was a classification problem so I used logistic regression method to predict the outcomes.
